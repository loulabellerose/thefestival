#thefestival

Highly detailed brief required a responsive front-end site to market the festival, with a back-end for the site administrator to manage content, stage timetables etc and a separate back-end for festival artists to manage their information and bio.

Site admins can manage the user accounts of the artists, and can review applications of new artists who apply to play at the festival through a form on the site.

I chose Kevin & Perry as the theme for the fictional festival to celebrate 20 years since the release of the classic movie - the festival would of course take place in Ibiza.
